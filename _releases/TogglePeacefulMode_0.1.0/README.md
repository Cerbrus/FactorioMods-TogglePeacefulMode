# Toggle Peaceful Mode

This mod allows you to toggle "[Peaceful mode](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=World_generator&redirect=no#Peaceful_mode)" at will.

Normally, toggling peaceful mode through a lua command disables achievements for the save:  
`/c game.player.surface.peaceful_mode = true / false`  
This mod lets you circumvents that.

If you disable the mod, the "peaceful" setting will still be what it was last set to. This allows you to disable "peaceful" mode while keeping steam achievements enabled for non-modded games.

The mod shouldn't corrupt your save, but as always, back-up first.  
<sup><sub>(The author of this mod can 't be held responsible for corrupted saves ;-) )</sub></sup>

Note: The toggle will kill all (mobile) biters, as their "peacefulness" is set when they spawn. Afaik, this can't be updated.
