# Toggle Peaceful Mode

This [Factorio](http://www.factorio.com/) mod allows you to toggle "[Peaceful mode](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=World_generator&redirect=no#Peaceful_mode)" at will.  
Toggling peaceful mode through a lua command disables achievements for the save:  
`/c game.player.surface.peaceful_mode = true / false`  
This mod lets you circumvents that.

If you disable the mod, the "peaceful" setting will be what it's last set to. This allows you to disable "peaceful" mode while keeping (steam) achievements enabled.

The mod shouldn't corrupt your save, but as always, back-up first.  
<sup><sub>(The author of this mod can 't be held responsible for corrupted saves ;-) )</sub></sup>


# How to Use

1. Start Factorio.
2. Open the "Mod" menu.
3. Search for the "Toggle Peaceful Mode" mod.
4. Install the mod.
5. Use the button on the top-left to toggle peaceful mode at will.  
Note: This will kill all (mobile) biters, as their "peacefulness" is set when they spawn. Afaik, this can't be updated.
